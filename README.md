## Technical Challenge

This is my first medium/big react application. In this project i learned to handle with react router dom, where i created the site routes, protected routes (only registered users can access), the react hooks, such as, useNavigate, useContext (to access some preset data on anywhere in the application), useState, useEffect, custom hooks and an external library called Victory to created the graphs with the number of views per photo in the user's profile.

<br>

The project is a social network for dogs, where you can post photos with a the dog's name, age and weigth. The application allows you to create a new account, where validate if there is any account with the same data, such as email and username. After you created your new account and post some awesome photos of your dog, you can check in the "Estat√≠sticas" page to see how your photos are performace.

On the feed, you can access your photos and the others user photos as well. If you see some photo that you like, feel free to leave a comment in the comments section.
